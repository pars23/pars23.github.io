		Most of my design practices are category of typography and book design, based on the
		new curriculums at UIC.These courses are designed for different proposes to improve 
		our skills and visual communications. For example expression, it is way to show a word, logo, and poster. Expressing an idea in way that everyone can get it. 

Another concept is which I have done a project on second year of my major was a process book, which was a serious of steps to the whole book. First of all, we all had to choose an object, the do some drawings of it then draw them on illustrator to make analytic. After that we went through process in illustrator which were about to make the object first with most details then each time reduce the details to simpler format like abstract. In addition to it we had to use paint to do our process. Then at the all of these illustrations came to show how this object transforms, from basic drawing to more detailed and abstract illustrations. 
	Moreover, I have done some book designs based on story I have written. Basically, we all had to write a story and try to visualize it as much as we can. My story was about orange juice, so I had to visualize the image of the juice more than the text. The goal was to show  easy illustrations for people in any age to understand 
 In concept of typography, we did a book in alphabet translations from hand made material to illustrations, which basically was to show different approach of showing alphabets. 
	All of these designs were based on Swiss design, which our school of design is providing to us in order to become different designers with different practices along our career.
